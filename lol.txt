Damage

Please read the following disclaimer carefully before considering the use 
of WTFis, an unfinished jailbreak tool. This disclaimer is intended to 
outline the potential risks involved and clarify the user's 
non-responsibility for any damage caused to iPhones when utilizing WTFis.

1. Unfinished Jailbreak Tool:
WTFis is an unfinished jailbreak tool designed to bypass software 
restrictions on iPhones. It should be noted that WTFis is a work in 
progress and may lack essential stability, compatibility, and security 
features. As an unfinished tool, it is inherently prone to unexpected 
errors, bugs, and compatibility issues with various iPhone models and 
software versions.

2. Risks and Consequences:
By choosing to use WTFis, you acknowledge and accept the potential risks 
associated with jailbreaking your iPhone. These risks may include, but are 
not limited to:

a) Loss of Warranty: Jailbreaking an iPhone typically voids the 
manufacturer's warranty. Any damage or malfunction caused to the device 
during or after the jailbreak process may not be covered under the 
original warranty.

b) Software Instability: WTFis, being unfinished, may result in software 
instability, leading to device crashes, freezing, or unresponsiveness. 
This instability can affect the overall performance and functionality of 
your iPhone.

c) Security Vulnerabilities: Jailbreaking can expose your device to 
security vulnerabilities, making it more susceptible to malicious 
software, unauthorized access, and potential data breaches. WTFis, being 
unfinished, may not have implemented necessary security measures, further 
increasing these risks.

d) Incompatibility: WTFis may not be compatible with all iPhone models, 
iOS versions, or third-party applications. Compatibility issues may cause 
certain features or applications to malfunction or become inaccessible.

3. User Responsibility:
While WTFis is provided for informational purposes, it is crucial to 
understand that the tool's development and usage are entirely at your own 
risk. By proceeding with the jailbreaking process using WTFis, you assume 
full responsibility for any consequences that may arise.

4. Non-Responsibility for iPhone Damage:
The creators, developers, and distributors of WTFis explicitly disclaim 
any responsibility or liability for any damage, loss of data, malfunction, 
or other negative outcomes resulting from the use of WTFis. You agree that 
the use of WTFis is your own decision, and you will not hold any parties 
associated with WTFis accountable for any adverse effects on your iPhone 
or personal property.

Conclusion:
By proceeding to use WTFis, you acknowledge that it is an unfinished 
jailbreak tool and understand the potential risks involved. You accept 
full responsibility for any consequences that may arise from using WTFis 
and agree not to hold any parties associated with WTFis responsible for 
any damage to your iPhone or any related issues. It is recommended that 
you exercise caution and make an informed decision before utilizing WTFis 
or any other jailbreak tool.
